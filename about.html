            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Cryptocurrency crimes, such as money laundering, ransomware payments, and fraud, are rapidly increasing. 
            Due to the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions, tracking these activities is extremely challenging 
            for investigators and regulatory bodies worldwide.</p>
            
            <h2>Our Solution</h2>
            <p><strong>Crypto Crime Watcher</strong> is an AI-powered prototype that simulates the process of identifying 
            and analyzing suspicious crypto wallet addresses. By gathering data from various online sources, 
            including public forums and dark web leaks, it categorizes risk levels and visualizes trends 
            to support proactive investigation.</p>

            <h2>Core Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Detection of suspicious wallet addresses using AI models</li>
                <li>Visualization of risk distribution through analytics charts</li>
                <li>Interactive dashboard for searching and exporting data</li>
                <li>Modular frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
            <p>This is a <strong>prototype</strong> version. In the real-world implementation, 
            we plan to include <strong>backend integration</strong> using technologies like 
            <em>Node.js</em> or <em>Python Flask</em>, database connectivity (e.g., MongoDB / PostgreSQL), 
            and real-time blockchain monitoring APIs for live data tracking. 
            Future upgrades may also involve advanced AI algorithms and security compliance layers.</p>
